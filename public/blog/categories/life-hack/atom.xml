    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spend a vast majority of my week positioned squarely on my butt. It&rsquo;s a sedentary life, which is why I&rsquo;ve had to start
working out again, but it&rsquo;s one that I love and get paid to live. Not that I&rsquo;m not phyically capable of working to earn
a living, it&rsquo;s simply that someone values my mind more than my body at this point. I&rsquo;m ok with that but I&rsquo;ve come to
realize that these two things aren&rsquo;t as separate as I used to think. I have things I do to keep both in line and they
have become way more important as I&rsquo;ve grown older (and hopefully wiser).</p>

<p>No, this is not another post about exercise - at least not by the standard definition of that word. It&rsquo;s more about the
things we need to do to exercise our minds and to have &ldquo;quiet times&rdquo; for that. I love being outdoors and my favorite activity of the week is mowing the lawn. It&rsquo;s a time for me to do some rote work that frees my mind up to wander and explore.
It&rsquo;s prayer time, reflection time, an opportunity to process and
expand on the ideas banging around inside my head. Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>I realized that this time has allowed me to clarify a lot of my thoughts. It allows me time to think thru what is going
on in my life and work. I can exand ideas and game-film interactions that I know are coming so that the best possible
results can be achieved. Realizing all this led me to a few other interesting thoughts&hellip;what would it take to cause me
to hire someone to mow? It&rsquo;s time that I value greatly and would have to replace in some other way to achieve the same
level of thoughtfulness so it&rsquo;s trade off would be a big one. So then, what else can I delegate to allow me to continue
mowing? At this point, I&rsquo;m not willing to outsource my family or my job so I guess I&rsquo;ll have to keep thinking about it.
While mowing, of course.</p>
