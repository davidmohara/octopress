    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sites like quora are time sinks for the virtual wisdom they provide. They're like brain candy. Don't get me wrong, I
love candy too, but it's no substitute for a good meal. People are more interested in collecting knowledge and parading
it around as wisdom rather than acting upon it to discover the true nature of that knowledge. Experience is the only
true impartation of wisdom. Everything else is just academic.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spend a vast majority of my week positioned squarely on my butt. It's a sedentary life, which is why I've had to start
working out again, but it's one that I love and get paid to live. Not that I'm not phyically capable of working to earn
a living, it's simply that someone values my mind more than my body at this point. I'm ok with that but I've come to
realize that these two things aren't as separate as I used to think. I have things I do to keep both in line and they
have become way more important as I've grown older (and hopefully wiser).</p>

<p>No, this is not another post about exercise - at least not by the standard definition of that word. It's more about the
things we need to do to exercise our minds and to have "quiet times" for that. I love being outdoors and my favorite activity of the week is mowing the lawn. It's a time for me to do some rote work that frees my mind up to wander and explore.
It's prayer time, reflection time, an opportunity to process and
expand on the ideas banging around inside my head. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='My wife likes to tease me about it being the loudest quiet time imaginable. '> My wife likes to tease me about it being the loudest quiet time imaginable. </span></p>

<p>I realized that this time has allowed me to clarify a lot of my thoughts. It allows me time to think thru what is going
on in my life and work. I can exand ideas and game-film interactions that I know are coming so that the best possible
results can be achieved. Realizing all this led me to a few other interesting thoughts...what would it take to cause me
to hire someone to mow? It's time that I value greatly and would have to replace in some other way to achieve the same
level of thoughtfulness so it's trade off would be a big one. So then, what else can I delegate to allow me to continue
mowing? At this point, I'm not willing to outsource my family or my job so I guess I'll have to keep thinking about it.
While mowing, of course.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Saying "I don't know" is hard. It's an admission of a shortcoming, a lack. It says, "I lack knowledge" or "I lack understanding".
Not saying it is worse though. Making up some sort of answer says the same thing, shows the same lack, but it includes
a lie; an inability to admit reality or be perceived as inadequate. News flash: we all are inadequate (on a way more frequent basis
than we'd like to admit). The difference is you choose to ignore reality. A lack of knowledge is something that could possibly be
remedied. But lying about realities, that's intrinsic, something fundamental and not something that you can easily
fix. Oh, and the person you're talking to will know it - they just might be polite enough not to say anything. Do yourself a favor;
just say "I don't know" and we can both go from there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks back I had multiple client and business needs that required me to dress up a little more than I usually do.
After enduring the standard, "You got an interview or something?" wise cracks that are inevitable, I began to notice
a change behaviors in a couple of ways. Now I want to be clear, I believe the old maxim, <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='&#8220;The clothes make the man&#8221; is BS. I am not what I wear. I am not my designer label. '> "The clothes make the man" is BS. I am not what I wear. I am not my designer label. </span> But...the clothes are an outwards manifestation of something
internal. They don't make you work any harder or be more productive but if your job involves appearances in any way,
you're at a disadvantage. They make people see you in a particular way, like it or not, we are a prejudicial people.
You make snap judgements; everyone does. Fighting reality is futile (but that's another post). Give it a shot yourself
- take 3 weeks and shift how you dress, then see what differences have come up in both your personal attitude and that
  of those around you...</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are regularly told that we should "think before we speak", however, I believe it
to be equally important that we think before we act. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Never be dictated to by expediency. '> Never be dictated to by expediency. </span> was a regular saying from my father.
And I have to say that, historically in my life at least, he's been correct. Now
I know that we all end up in situations where we need to make snap decisions or
something needs to be handled in the immediate - that's just life but there are
also times when some reflection and careful thought can be afforded.
Unfortunately, no one has every taught me what to actually do with that time.</p>

<h2>The Canvas</h2>

<p>So if I'm supposed to be thoughtful about what it is I do in specific situations, how do I achieve that? Well, I don't know if it's the solution for everyone but I've got a template that works for me and I wanted to share with you all. You can find it at <a href="http://journal.driventodevelop.com">http://journal.driventodevelop.com</a>. It's a pretty simple and self-explanatory template (if you need a hint there's an instruction box in the top right that I'm working to make contextual help). I needed a quick way to throw some security on it so it uses Twitter for authentication but I assure you I'm not collecting any kind of info otherwise. In the past couple weeks, I have been surprised how much this has helped me with situations I was experiencing and brought things to a significantly better conclusion that I had hoped for at the outset. Give it a shot and let me know what you think...</p>
