Have you ever heard of having an “open door” policy? More than likely. Have you ever found that to be a lie? Sadly, more
than likely. Often times companies, or individuals, like to claim that they have this policy but aren’t truly interested
in being accessible. They believe that given sufficient access, folks would consume all their time and no work would get
done. Not me. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='I love to tell people that I’m always available.'> I love to tell people that I’m always available. </span> This breeds trust in
the people that I give that information to; they know they can have access to me anytime they may need it. This doesn’t
mean that I’ll drop everything to talk with them any time they ask but I will make room for them and allow them to help
prioritize their needs in the queue that is my job. Also, that allows me to push the responsibility on to them and trust
that they'll only contact me when needed and not for frivolous things. People don’t like to be a bother and aren’t
looking to waste your time so I don't need to filter them thru anything to be sure they're not wasting time. They seem
to do that on their own. Granted, there are always exceptions and some that are more likely to take advantage but those
are edge cases. And we all know you do your best not to mandate to exceptions; just treat them as exceptions and deal
with them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/capitalist_pig.jpg">"Capitalism" is typically a word that evokes images of a fat business man on a pile of other people's hard work and
money. It's not a pretty image and certainly not one that most folks want to be associated with. No one wants to think
the profits of their efforts feed some singluarly greedy entity, personal or corporate. However, the reality of business
is that it REQUIRES profits to maintain it's ability to run and provide the opportunity for folks to work and provide
for themselves and their families. So how do we break out of that mold? Can business be both good and profitable?</p>

<h3>Conscious Capitalism</h3>

<p>I've recently become aware of <a href="http://www.consciouscapitalism.org">Conscious Capitalism</a>. It was started
by John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, and Kip Tindell, CEO of Container Store, as a movement towards a more holistic view
of corporate responsibility to a larger audience and a deeper purpose. Basically, profits are not evil but should be
focused on the environment that produced them as a way to grow the business. To illustrate this, we have the
Stakeholder Model - whereas typical business focuses on the shareholder and customers as the main stakeholders in a
business' success, we believe in the larger perspective of stakeholders. The employees who provide value to our
customers, industry that we are working in, the suppliers who provide us with the goods we need to produce value, as
well as the community we live in. Without any one of these critical stakeholders, the company would be decreased and
less effective. These are the relationships that we should focus on and be investing in. By focusing on this larger
perspective, we are able to feed back significantly to the ecosystem that we live in.</p>

<p>For me this was a "duh" moment. Of course there's a broader perspective (there usually is if you are paying attention)
and it was great to have a framework and vocabulary to match the things I have believed and been living for a while now.
Let me explain...</p>

<h3>Improving</h3>

<p>One of the founding ideas of <a href="http://improvingenterprises.com">Improving</a> was that we would be THE place that people want to work. A place that you can
find fullfillment and success in what you do. A place that focused on people and relationships first and foremost. This was a VERY different philosophy than what I had come thru previously in my
career. At Improving, we cared about our customers and their success as most businesses do but there was more. Our
suppliers would come and hang out with us (one in particular spends mornings at our office to have coffee and chat about
family and life). The vast majority of the user groups in the area used our facilities and were given pizza and drinks for free.
We spoke at a significant number of conferences and attended them in packs. We fundraised for the local community and
found ways to contribute time and money to the types of charities I've come to believe make a difference. Most of all,
people cared about each other. They truly and honestly were involved in each other's lives both inside and outside of
work. I don't want to paint things too perfect, they're not. We have our share of challenges and are always looking at
ways to be better but we
have a perspective for what could be and now we have a model for speaking to that. It's been cool to see how the things laid
out by Conscious Capitalism are what have been built into Improving from the start. And to see that something that
sounds idealistic can be a reality and, even better, a success.</p>

    <link href="http://driventodevelop.com/blog/time-for-work/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p><strong><em> This is a perspective I'm currently exploring and so I'm arguing both sides. You've been warned. </em></strong></p>

<h2>Family</h2>

<p>When we need time for something it must be taken. It cannot be replaced or given back or returned, we consume it and it's gone.
Often times when you need that extra time to get something done, like a meeting or conversation, we steal that time from our families.
We steal from them because they love us and will forgive us. We don't seem to steal that time from the people we work for/with. But why is that?
Our drive to perform or excel, to be perfect at work, overrides our drive to be the same at home.
When I take that extra hour to have another meeting or to finish conversation or do another report, I'm stealing from my son or my wife. This is
an emotional representation rather than a factual one to be clear but that doesn't make it any less accurate. Perceptions are reality.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>I was made for this. The gifts I have been given, the talents that I possess, the knowledge that I have acquired...all align to what I am doing.
I am fulfilling my purpose. I was made to work and by living up to that potential I am setting an example for my family. The provisions that we have
are because of this effort and we can enjoy them as the blessings that they truly are. When I take the time to make sure a job is done right
I am showing my children how to be diligent in their work.</p>

<p>You can't steal what is given freely. If I put a basket of pennies somewhere with a sign
"Take as many as you need" and you take them all, it wasn't stealing. Often times our families give freely, where our employers do not, and that's
not stealing. This is where the recent trend of "unlimited" vacation time has started to shift that mindset but that's a different post...</p>

<h2>Balance is NOT the goal</h2>

<p>You cannot balance two things that are fundamentally unequal. It's like closing one eye and holding up a yellow M&amp;M until it's the same size as the sun in the sky.
Now they're the same, right? Looking at something thru a single dimensionality is a farce and by no means a measure of that thing. Size alone doesn't make them the same
any more than me spending more time at work than home makes one more significant than the other.</p>

    <link href="http://driventodevelop.com/blog/excel-is-a-cul-de-sac/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-28T08:20:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://driventodevelop.com/blog/excel-is-a-cul-de-sac</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my recent transition, I've had to become even more intimate with Excel as a tool of my job. Previously I've used Excel
in crazy ways, as a data source for an ODBC connection or a pass thru between disconnected services, but now it's
something to run the business on. That's a knife that cuts both ways though.</p>

<h2>The Current State</h2>

<p>Excel is an extremely useful app and the learning curve on it is fairly low. Things you would typically do are easily
found via Google and most C-level folks have been mashing up formulas for a good hunk of time. I can safely say there
are some companies of significant size that are run off of Excel spreadsheets that are passed around via email
(don't even get me started on the lack of Dropbox use). It works fairly well and, while seemingly creating only a small
amount of overhead, gets the job done. But there's a big problem underlying this behavior.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>New people. Ok, so the new people aren't the actual problem but they surface the start of the problem. When data is pulled from a
source system into Excel it can be sliced, diced, and manipulated until it says what you need it to but that's it. It's
done. And it was almost always manual. Rarely is the manipulation reproducible by anyone other than the person who just
did it because that would require the use of macros and VBScript and stuff that only developers really grok. Strike #1.</p>

<p>Manipulated data is dead in Excel, like those dead tree requirements docs we have all decided were a less
than ideal way to do things. You can't pull new data into the existing spreadsheet and have it follow the transformation to add
to the output. No, instead you pull new data and start back at square one. Strike #2.</p>

<p>Did you want to use that data in some other system or feed it back into the one that it originally came from? No joy
here. The data cannot be consumed in as easy a fashion as it was put into Excel. Sure you can get a developer to monkey
up an ODBC connection like I did before but that's not something most executives are going to be able to pull off.
Maybe they're able to string together a set of Excel sheets that refer to each other and use the data between them but
that's a tangled and fragile web. And given the prior two issues, we know what sort of overhead maintaining that is
going to be when it comes time to update with new data. Strike #3.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I'm not against using Excel, heck, I do it on a pretty regular basis. I'm against it's overuse; the crutch that it
becomes when folks just want a one off thing (until it isn't), for just a few people (until there's more), and won't
need again (until they do). When you need something more, step up and move out of your comfort zone, find a tool that
supports what you need and isn't a three strike offender.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know it's been a while since I posted (a typical excuse, right?) but I've been pretty busy lately. Let me fill you
in...</p>

<p>This summer our company decide to create additional positions for the VP of consulting since we had grown to
over 90 consultants and I was promoted to one of those positions. It was a great opportunity for me to better connect
with a number of our folks but also for me to increase my involvement in the business aspects of the company. I enjoy
meeting with everyone and talking, not only about what's going on with their client or our company, but also helping
them in figuring out what their career path looks like and where they want to go. It's something that I'm really
passionate about; the future.</p>

<p>So even more recently, our president, Barry Rogers, decided to semi-retire. He and his wife have always wanted to have a different
work-life ratio than what they currently enjoyed and so are making a change. You can read a little more about their plans as well as their upcoming/on-going adventures
at <a href="http://webebalanced.com/">We Be Balanced</a>. Given this decision, it was announced that I will be taking over as president beginning in 2013. I'm excited about the direction our company is heading and the opportunity to help
shape and steer things. I realize this means I will have to prioritize my focus a little differently and, while I'm
unlikely to give up on my late night coding sessions entirely, they will probably become a little less frequent.</p>
