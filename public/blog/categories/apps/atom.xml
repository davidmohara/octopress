    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are regularly told that we should &ldquo;think before we speak&rdquo;, however, I believe it
to be equally important that we think before we act. Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "} was a regular saying from my father.
And I have to say that, historically in my life at least, he&rsquo;s been correct. Now
I know that we all end up in situations where we need to make snap decisions or
something needs to be handled in the immediate &ndash; that&rsquo;s just life but there are
also times when some reflection and careful thought can be afforded.
Unfortunately, no one has every taught me what to actually do with that time.</p>

<h2>The Canvas</h2>

<p>So if I&rsquo;m supposed to be thoughtful about what it is I do in specific situations, how do I achieve that? Well, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the solution for everyone but I&rsquo;ve got a template that works for me and I wanted to share with you all. You can find it at <a href="http://journal.driventodevelop.com">http://journal.driventodevelop.com</a>. It&rsquo;s a pretty simple and self-explanatory template (if you need a hint there&rsquo;s an instruction box in the top right that I&rsquo;m working to make contextual help). I needed a quick way to throw some security on it so it uses Twitter for authentication but I assure you I&rsquo;m not collecting any kind of info otherwise. In the past couple weeks, I have been surprised how much this has helped me with situations I was experiencing and brought things to a significantly better conclusion that I had hoped for at the outset. Give it a shot and let me know what you think&hellip;</p>
