    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's not you...it's me. I have been meaning to do this for a long time and while I don't think there is ever a <em>right</em> time for a break up like this, I think the time is now.</p>

<h2>Calling It</h2>

<p>There have a been a lot of changes in my life recently and I think that they are
beginning to effect my perspective on life. Honestly, I sort of hope that they
do. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Life is short. So damn short, in fact, that it is not worth running thru if you&#8217;re not enjoying what little time we have on this rock.'>Life is short. So damn short, in fact, that it is not worth running thru if you're not enjoying what little time we have on this rock.</span>
  To that end, I am rebooting my blogging life. The old stuff will remain
  <a href="http://blog.davidohara.net">here</a> but my new adventures and musings will be here. Maybe at
  some point I'll combine the two domains in some non-breaking way but right now I don't want the hassle
  so I'm declaring blog bankruptcy and just moving forward.</p>

<h2>New Setup</h2>

<p>Like so many others, I have decided to give <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>
a shot. I won't bother you will any details since so many others have done
a great job of explaining how to get things up and going but I can say that so far I've been very impressed. Initially, my intention is to blog at least once a week and see where that takes me. They're not going to be long posts (I'm hoping this will help me in my follow thru) and I hope that they'll be more than semi-coherent ramblings. Guess we will have to see...</p>
