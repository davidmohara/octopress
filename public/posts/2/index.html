  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know it&rsquo;s been a while since I posted (a typical excuse, right?) but I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy lately. Let me fill you
in&hellip;</p>

<p>This summer our company decide to create additional positions for the VP of consulting since we had grown to
over 90 consultants and I was promoted to one of those positions. It was a great opportunity for me to better connect
with a number of our folks but also for me to increase my involvement in the business aspects of the company. I enjoy
meeting with everyone and talking, not only about what&rsquo;s going on with their client or our company, but also helping
them in figuring out what their career path looks like and where they want to go. It&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m really
passionate about; the future.</p>

<p>So even more recently, our president, Barry Rogers, decided to semi-retire. He and his wife have always wanted to have a different
work-life ratio than what they currently enjoyed and so are making a change. You can read a little more about their plans as well as their upcoming/on-going adventures
at <a href="http://webebalanced.com/">We Be Balanced</a>. Given this decision, it was announced that I will be taking over as president beginning in 2013. I&rsquo;m excited about the direction our company is heading and the opportunity to help
shape and steer things. I realize this means I will have to prioritize my focus a little differently and, while I&rsquo;m
unlikely to give up on my late night coding sessions entirely, they will probably become a little less frequent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; is hard. It&rsquo;s an admission of a shortcoming, a lack. It says, &ldquo;I lack knowledge&rdquo; or &ldquo;I lack understanding&rdquo;.
Not saying it is worse though. Making up some sort of answer says the same thing, shows the same lack, but it includes
a lie; an inability to admit reality or be perceived as inadequate. News flash: we all are inadequate (on a way more frequent basis
than we&rsquo;d like to admit). The difference is you choose to ignore reality. A lack of knowledge is something that could possibly be
remedied. But lying about realities, that&rsquo;s intrinsic, something fundamental and not something that you can easily
fix. Oh, and the person you&rsquo;re talking to will know it - they just might be polite enough not to say anything. Do yourself a favor;
just say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; and we can both go from there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks back I had multiple client and business needs that required me to dress up a little more than I usually do.
After enduring the standard, &ldquo;You got an interview or something?&rdquo; wise cracks that are inevitable, I began to notice
a change behaviors in a couple of ways. Now I want to be clear, I believe the old maxim, <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='“The clothes make the man” is BS. I am not what I wear. I am not my designer label.'> &ldquo;The clothes make the man&rdquo; is BS. I am not what I wear. I am not my designer label. </span> But&hellip;the clothes are an outwards manifestation of something
internal. They don&rsquo;t make you work any harder or be more productive but if your job involves appearances in any way,
you&rsquo;re at a disadvantage. They make people see you in a particular way, like it or not, we are a prejudicial people.
You make snap judgements; everyone does. Fighting reality is futile (but that&rsquo;s another post). Give it a shot yourself
- take 3 weeks and shift how you dress, then see what differences have come up in both your personal attitude and that
  of those around you&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are regularly told that we should &ldquo;think before we speak&rdquo;, however, I believe it
to be equally important that we think before we act. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Never be dictated to by expediency.'> Never be dictated to by expediency. </span> was a regular saying from my father.
And I have to say that, historically in my life at least, he&rsquo;s been correct. Now
I know that we all end up in situations where we need to make snap decisions or
something needs to be handled in the immediate - that&rsquo;s just life but there are
also times when some reflection and careful thought can be afforded.
Unfortunately, no one has every taught me what to actually do with that time.</p>

<h2>The Canvas</h2>

<p>So if I&rsquo;m supposed to be thoughtful about what it is I do in specific situations, how do I achieve that? Well, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the solution for everyone but I&rsquo;ve got a template that works for me and I wanted to share with you all. You can find it at <a href="http://journal.driventodevelop.com">http://journal.driventodevelop.com</a>. It&rsquo;s a pretty simple and self-explanatory template (if you need a hint there&rsquo;s an instruction box in the top right that I&rsquo;m working to make contextual help). I needed a quick way to throw some security on it so it uses Twitter for authentication but I assure you I&rsquo;m not collecting any kind of info otherwise. In the past couple weeks, I have been surprised how much this has helped me with situations I was experiencing and brought things to a significantly better conclusion that I had hoped for at the outset. Give it a shot and let me know what you think&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://twitter.com/davidmohara/status/144168515207823361">tweeted</a> before about this but felt, as is often the case, that it could be percieved as a bit
flippant with regards to how I feel about the startups I encounter. While those
who know me will agree that I rarely take myself too seriously, I am serious
about new ideas and how they could change things but I don&rsquo;t need you to tell me
that. Let me back up a second&hellip;</p>

<h2>Flys Buzz</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Startups don&rsquo;t buzz, flys do; and it&rsquo;s usually around horseshit&rdquo; Far too often
I have an idea pitched to me that is little more than a haphazard collection of
buzzwords and acronyms. If your idea needs something like that to make it
attractive, you need a new idea. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Making it “social” or using gamification will only work if your idea doesn’t suck to begin with.'>Making it &ldquo;social&rdquo; or using gamification will only work if your idea doesn&rsquo;t suck to begin with.</span> Start there and <strong>then</strong> work
your way into the other bits, not the other way around. That&rsquo;s the idea I want
pitched to me. And don&rsquo;t tell me &ldquo;I think&rdquo; this or that, I can&rsquo;t measure &ldquo;I
think&rdquo;. Show me some sort of actual data - even if it&rsquo;s a SWAG it at least shows
me you&rsquo;ve thought things thru enough to put numbers around. Ok, enough of a side
rant.</p>

<h2>Labels</h2>

<p>Now to the main point of my tweet. The reason why I will stop listening when you
use the term &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; in your pitch is that disruptive
can only be applied in hindsight, thru the lens of
success. Twitter didn&rsquo;t set out to be disruptive, Amazon wasn&rsquo;t bankrolled
because they were disruptive, they set out to solve a problem. That&rsquo;s
what you need to focus on: solving someone&rsquo;s pain. If you can show me how you
deliver value in that direction (and how you intend to reach out to people with that pain), then I&rsquo;m
interested. So now, go sit down and rethink your elevator pitch without using
a single buzzword - then give me a call cause I&rsquo;d love to hear it&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s not you&hellip;it&rsquo;s me. I have been meaning to do this for a long time and while I don&rsquo;t think there is ever a <em>right</em> time for a break up like this, I think the time is now.</p>

<h2>Calling It</h2>

<p>There have a been a lot of changes in my life recently and I think that they are
beginning to effect my perspective on life. Honestly, I sort of hope that they
do. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Life is short. So damn short, in fact, that it is not worth running thru if you’re not enjoying what little time we have on this rock.'>Life is short. So damn short, in fact, that it is not worth running thru if you&rsquo;re not enjoying what little time we have on this rock.</span>
  To that end, I am rebooting my blogging life. The old stuff will remain
  <a href="http://blog.davidohara.net">here</a> but my new adventures and musings will be here. Maybe at
  some point I&rsquo;ll combine the two domains in some non-breaking way but right now I don&rsquo;t want the hassle
  so I&rsquo;m declaring blog bankruptcy and just moving forward.</p>

<h2>New Setup</h2>

<p>Like so many others, I have decided to give <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>
a shot. I won&rsquo;t bother you will any details since so many others have done
a great job of explaining how to get things up and going but I can say that so far I&rsquo;ve been very impressed. Initially, my intention is to blog at least once a week and see where that takes me. They&rsquo;re not going to be long posts (I&rsquo;m hoping this will help me in my follow thru) and I hope that they&rsquo;ll be more than semi-coherent ramblings. Guess we will have to see&hellip;</p>
