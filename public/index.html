  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://twitter.com/davidmohara/status/144168515207823361">tweeted</a> before about this but felt, as is often the case, that it could be percieved as a bit
flippant with regards to how I feel about the startups I encounter. While those
who know me will agree that I rarely take myself too seriously, I am serious
about new ideas and how they could change things but I don&#8217;t need you to tell me
that. Let me back up a second&#8230;</p>

<h2>Flys Buzz</h2>

<p>&#8220;Startups don&#8217;t buzz, flys do; and it&#8217;s usually around horseshit&#8221; Far too often
I have an idea pitched to me that is little more than a haphazard collection of
buzzwords and acronyms. If your idea needs something like that to make it
attractive, you need a new idea. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Making it &#8220;social&#8221; or using gamification will only work if your idea doesn&#8217;t suck to begin with. '>Making it &#8220;social&#8221; or using gamification will only work if your idea doesn&#8217;t suck to begin with.</span> Start there and <strong>then</strong> work
your way into the other bits, not the other way around. That&#8217;s the idea I want
pitched to me. And don&#8217;t tell me &#8220;I think&#8221; this or that, I can&#8217;t measure &#8220;I
think&#8221;. Show me some sort of actual data - even if it&#8217;s a SWAG it at least shows
me you&#8217;ve thought things thru enough to put numbers around. Ok, enough of a side
rant.</p>

<h2>Labels</h2>

<p>Now to the main point of my tweet. The reason why I will stop listening when you
use the term &#8220;disruptive&#8221; in your pitch is that disruptive
can only be applied in hindsight, thru the lens of
success. Twitter didn&#8217;t set out to be disruptive, Amazon wasn&#8217;t bankrolled
because they were disruptive, they set out to solve a problem. That&#8217;s
what you need to focus on: solving someone&#8217;s pain. If you can show me how you
deliver value in that direction (and how you intend to reach out to people with that pain), then I&#8217;m
interested. So now, go sit down and rethink your elevator pitch without using
a single buzzword - then give me a call cause I&#8217;d love to hear it&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s not you&#8230;it&#8217;s me. I have been meaning to do this for a long time and while I don&#8217;t think there is ever a <em>right</em> time for a break up like this, I think the time is now.</p>

<h2>Calling It</h2>

<p>There have a been a lot of changes in my life recently and I think that they are
beginning to effect my perspective on life. Honestly, I sort of hope that they
do. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Life is short. So damn short, in fact, that it is not worth running thru if you&#8217;re not enjoying what little time we have on this rock.'>Life is short. So damn short, in fact, that it is not worth running thru if you&#8217;re not enjoying what little time we have on this rock.</span>
  To that end, I am rebooting my blogging life. The old stuff will remain
  <a href="http://blog.davidohara.net">here</a> but my new adventures and musings will be here. Maybe at
  some point I&#8217;ll combine the two domains in some non-breaking way but right now I don&#8217;t want the hassle
  so I&#8217;m declaring blog bankruptcy and just moving forward.</p>

<h2>New Setup</h2>

<p>Like so many others, I have decided to give <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>
a shot. I won&#8217;t bother you will any details since so many others have done
a great job of explaining how to get things up and going but I can say that so far I&#8217;ve been very impressed. Initially, my intention is to blog at least once a week and see where that takes me. They&#8217;re not going to be long posts (I&#8217;m hoping this will help me in my follow thru) and I hope that they&#8217;ll be more than semi-coherent ramblings. Guess we will have to see&#8230;</p>
