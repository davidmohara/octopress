Sites like quora are time sinks for the virtual wisdom they provide. They're like brain candy. Don't get me wrong, I
love candy too, but it's no substitute for a good meal. People are more interested in collecting knowledge and parading
it around as wisdom rather than acting upon it to discover the true nature of that knowledge. Experience is the only
true impartation of wisdom. Everything else is just academic.
