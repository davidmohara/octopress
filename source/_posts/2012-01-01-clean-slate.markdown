It's not you...it's me. I have been meaning to do this for a long time and while I don't think there is ever a *right* time for a break up like this, I think the time is now.

## Calling It
There have a been a lot of changes in my life recently and I think that they are
beginning to effect my perspective on life. Honestly, I sort of hope that they
do. {% pullquote %}{"Life is short. So damn short, in fact, that it is not worth running thru if you're not enjoying what little time we have on this rock."}{% endpullquote %}
  To that end, I am rebooting my blogging life. The old stuff will remain
  [here](http://blog.davidohara.net) but my new adventures and musings will be here. Maybe at
  some point I'll combine the two domains in some non-breaking way but right now I don't want the hassle
  so I'm declaring blog bankruptcy and just moving forward.

## New Setup
Like so many others, I have decided to give [Octopress](http://octopress.org)
a shot. I won't bother you will any details since so many others have done
a great job of explaining how to get things up and going but I can say that so far I've been very impressed. Initially, my intention is to blog at least once a week and see where that takes me. They're not going to be long posts (I'm hoping this will help me in my follow thru) and I hope that they'll be more than semi-coherent ramblings. Guess we will have to see...
