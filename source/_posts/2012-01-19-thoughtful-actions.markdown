We are regularly told that we should "think before we speak", however, I believe it
to be equally important that we think before we act. {% pullquote %} {" Never be dictated to by expediency. "} {% endpullquote %} was a regular saying from my father.
And I have to say that, historically in my life at least, he's been correct. Now
I know that we all end up in situations where we need to make snap decisions or
something needs to be handled in the immediate - that's just life but there are
also times when some reflection and careful thought can be afforded.
Unfortunately, no one has every taught me what to actually do with that time.

## The Canvas
So if I'm supposed to be thoughtful about what it is I do in specific situations, how do I achieve that? Well, I don't know if it's the solution for everyone but I've got a template that works for me and I wanted to share with you all. You can find it at [http://journal.driventodevelop.com](http://journal.driventodevelop.com). It's a pretty simple and self-explanatory template (if you need a hint there's an instruction box in the top right that I'm working to make contextual help). I needed a quick way to throw some security on it so it uses Twitter for authentication but I assure you I'm not collecting any kind of info otherwise. In the past couple weeks, I have been surprised how much this has helped me with situations I was experiencing and brought things to a significantly better conclusion that I had hoped for at the outset. Give it a shot and let me know what you think...
