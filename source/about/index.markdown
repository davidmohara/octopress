Family
------
{% img left /images/us.jpg %}My family comes first. They are my #1 priority and nothing will ever get in the way of that. I have been blessed with a
wonderful and loving wife who supports me. Oh, and she's the one responsible for the kids being so cute. {% img right clear /images/crazy_kids.jpg %}
We are blessed to be living in Frisco and amongst our family and friends here and enjoy all that the area has to offer.

Career
------
I don't ascribe to the belief that we can truly separate who we are from what we do provided we have found the thing we
were meant to do. If you don't love your job, you're doing it wrong. I love what I do. It's not without it's challenges
and trials but that's also what motivates. There's a quote from Dr. J, "Being a professional is doing what the things you love to do on the days you
don't feel like doing them." and that's how I feel about my work. In 2007 I discovered the folks at [Improving Enterprises](http://improvingenterprises.com) and I'm so excited to see where we have come and where we are going as a
company. It's truly different than any other company I've worked for.
