Family
------
My kids come first. They are my #1 priority and nothing will ever get in the way of that. I have 3 awesome kids. {% img right clear /images/crazy_kids.jpg %} and we are blessed to be living in Frisco and amongst our family and friends here and enjoy all that the area has to offer.

Career
------
I don't ascribe to the belief that we can truly separate who we are from what we do provided we have found the thing we
were meant to do. If you don't love your job, you're doing it wrong. I love what I do. It's not without it's challenges
and trials but that's also what motivates me. There's a quote from Dr. J, "Being a professional is doing what the things you love to do on the days you don't feel like doing them." and that's how I feel about my work. In 2007 I discovered the folks at [Improving](http://improving.com) and I'm so excited to see where we have come and where we are going as a
company. It's truly different than any other company I've worked for.
